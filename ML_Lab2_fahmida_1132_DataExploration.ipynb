Series based on some criteria. For example, we can use the loc or iloc methods to slice by index labels or positions, and combine them with boolean masks to filter by values. Alternatively, we can use the query method to write the conditions as a string expression (which we will not use here)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"27cc6de2","metadata":{"id":"27cc6de2"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Let's find the underage people in the data set\n","df.loc[df['Age']\u003c18].head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"d01b638d","metadata":{"id":"d01b638d"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Now let's find underage people who are also female\n","df.loc[ (df['Age']\u003c20) \u0026 (df['Sex']=='female')].head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"GJ6HwQVZzJ3H","metadata":{"id":"GJ6HwQVZzJ3H"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a58624d0","metadata":{"id":"a58624d0"},"source":["**2.6 Cleaning Data**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"91bdac25","metadata":{"id":"91bdac25"},"source":["2.6.1 Dropping Missing Values"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"124f91ee","metadata":{"id":"124f91ee"},"outputs":[],"source":["# We will copy the dataframe first in order to not change the original\n","dft = df.copy()\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0509c322","metadata":{"id":"0509c322"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft.isnull().sum()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"72e3dfa1","metadata":{"id":"72e3dfa1"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Droppping missing values\n","dft = dft.dropna()\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"7de32807","metadata":{"id":"7de32807"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft = df.copy()\n","dft = dft.dropna(axis=1)\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"07c13bb2","metadata":{"id":"07c13bb2"},"source":["2.6.2 Replacing Missing Values"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"-S4o8ptk3KTX","metadata":{"id":"-S4o8ptk3KTX"},"outputs":[],"source":["df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2bd2c698","metadata":{"id":"2bd2c698"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft = df.copy()\n","dft.loc[dft['Age'].isnull()].head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"B_ZXRv8Q3Ob3","metadata":{"id":"B_ZXRv8Q3Ob3"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft['Age'].mean()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c2fecc7f","metadata":{"id":"c2fecc7f"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Get the mean of age\n","mean_value = dft['Age'].mean()\n","# Fill missing values using .fillna()\n","dft = dft.fillna(mean_value)\n","dft.loc[dft['Age'].isnull()].head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"vC9f7aHgB1be","metadata":{"id":"vC9f7aHgB1be"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft.loc[dft['Age'].isnull()].head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9abda3e6","metadata":{"id":"9abda3e6"},"source":["2.6.3 Removing Duplicates"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"294937bb","metadata":{"id":"294937bb"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft = df.copy()\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2c7707d8","metadata":{"id":"2c7707d8"},"outputs":[],"source":["dft = dft.drop_duplicates()\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"92f9e276","metadata":{"id":"92f9e276"},"source":["**2.7 Manipulating Columns**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"20a6deff","metadata":{"id":"20a6deff","scrolled":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# We can rename a column using the rename() method\n","dft = dft.rename(columns = {'Parch':'Porch'})\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"6055f170","metadata":{"id":"6055f170"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Now we will add a new column named baby\n","# baby is a boolean value column (1 or 0)\n","# It will show whether a passenger was a baby or not\n","dft['baby'] = 1\n","dft.loc[dft['Age']\u003e10, 'baby'] = 0\n","dft.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"2e16d910","metadata":{"id":"2e16d910"},"source":["**2.8 Further Analysis**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c012043c","metadata":{"id":"c012043c"},"outputs":[],"source":["# We can find mean, median, mode\n","df['Age'].mean()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"49a47c1d","metadata":{"id":"49a47c1d"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Find mean of age of females and males individually\n","df.groupby('sex')['age'].mean()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b4324914-8755-4bbe-8fb7-1c9c19645d03","metadata":{"id":"b4324914-8755-4bbe-8fb7-1c9c19645d03"},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f38f8a50-c713-46c0-a30a-1356dbb4c177","metadata":{"id":"f38f8a50-c713-46c0-a30a-1356dbb4c177"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"","version":""},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.13"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
