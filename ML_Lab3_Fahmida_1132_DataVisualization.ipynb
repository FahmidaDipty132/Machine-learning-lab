Matplotlib provides low-level functionality for creating various types of plots, such as line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc. Seaborn builds on top of matplotlib and offers high-level functions for creating more complex and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, such as heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots, etc. Seaborn also integrates well with pandas, a library for data analysis and manipulation.
